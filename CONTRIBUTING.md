# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, you'll have more luck with getting PRs approved if you come chat with us in the
Discord server and letting us know about what you are fixing/adding.
Keep in mind that clippy, rustfmt and cargo-audit are enforced on CI, so make sure your code passes these checks.

## Pull Request Process

1. Make sure all tests and lints pass. PRs that don't pass CI will be rejected if your code is the cause of the failing
   tests/lints.
2. Make sure all needed files are also included and not using absolute paths.
3. Include a sufficient explanation of your PR. What is it adding/fixing, why does this feature need to be added/fixed,
   who have you discussed this with, etc. If these questions were answered in a conversation on this Discord, mention
   who you talked with and what consensus was reached. Unexplained PRs will rarely be accepted.
4. Check again that tests pass.
5. Check a 3rd time.
6. Check that Clippy passes with no issues. `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -Dwarnings` is used on CI.
7. Check that Rustfmt passes with no issues. `cargo fmt --all -- --check` is used on CI.
8. Check that Cargo-audit passes with no issues. `cargo audit` is used on CI.
9. Submit PR.

## Testing

Run the full test suite before opening a pull request:

```
cargo nextest run --all-targets --all-features -E "not kind(bench)"
```

Format and lint the code as CI does:

```
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

Benchmarks can be compiled and executed with `cargo bench` when reviewing
performance changes.

## Project specific guidelines

Just some rules to try to keep the repo nice and organised

### Branches

#### `master`

This branch is the main branch. This is where all PRs should be made to. This branch is the most up to
date and should only be merged into with completed features.

#### `feature/feature-name`

This branch is for developing a feature. Once the feature is complete, a PR should be
made to the master branch. This branch should be branched off of the master branch.

#### `fix/fixed-thing`

This branch is for fixing a bug. Once the bug is fixed, a PR should be made to the master
branch. This branch should be branched off of the master branch.

#### `rework/refactored-thing`

This branch is for refactoring code. Once the code is refactored, a PR should be made to the master branch.

#### `housekeeping`

This branch is for stuff relating to the repo itself. This could be updating the README, adding
new CI checks, etc. This branch should be branched off of the master branch.

#### `docs`

This branch is for updating the documentation. This branch should be branched off of the master branch.
This is used for stuff that doesn't actually modify the code, but the documentation.

```

If you add a new directory, please add it to the above list along with its purpose.

### Code rules

1. Tests that only generate/dump data must be `#[ignore]`d. These tests are not useful for CI and should not be run.
2. No absolute paths. This will break the CI and make it harder to run the code on different machines.
3. Try to avoid just chaining `../` to get to the root of the project. This makes it harder to move files around and
   work
   out where a referenced file is. There is a `get_root_path()` function that can be used to get the root of the project
   as a
   PathBuf.
4. Don't be lazy and use `unwrap()`. If you are sure that a value will always be `Some`, use `expect()`. If you are not
   sure, use `match` or `if let`. Please also have a more detailed `error!()` message if you are using `expect()`.
5. Avoid `.clone()`ing data. If you need to clone data, make sure that it is necessary and that the data is not too
   large.
   Cloning is ok however in sections of code that only need to run once and small performance hits are acceptable (eg,
   loading config files, starting up the database).
6. New dependencies should be added to the workspace `Cargo.toml` file. This will make it easier to manage dependencies
   and will make sure that all dependencies are of the same version.
7. If you are adding a new feature that warrants major separation, add it as a new crate and then include it in the
   workspace `Cargo.toml` file. This will make it easier to manage the code and will make sure that the code is well
   separated.
8. If you are adding an extra sub-crate, you must create a new set of `thiserror` based error types for that crate. This
   will make it easier to understand where an error is coming from and will make it easier to handle errors.
9. Use `cargo clippy` to check for any issues with the code. This will be checked in CI and will cause the build to fail
   if there are any issues. There is no excuse for *your* code to fail the lints.
10. Use `cargo fmt` to format the code. This will be checked in CI and will cause the build to fail if the code is not
    formatted correctly. There is no excuse for *your* code to fail the formatting.
11. Use `#[expect(lint)]` instead of `#[allow(lint)]` if you are sure that the lint is not an issue. This will make it
    easier to find and remove these lints in the future.
12. Use `#[cfg(test)]` to only include code in tests. This will make the code easier to read and understand.
13. Where applicable, add doc strings to functions and modules. This will make it easier for others to understand the
    code.
    Check https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustdoc/how-to-write-documentation.html for more information on how to write
    good documentation.
14. Unsafe code is ok as long as it is well documented and the reason for the unsafe code is explained. If you are not
    sure if the code is safe, ask in the Discord.
15. Limit the use of raw instructions as much as possible. This will make the code easier to read and understand. There
    are some cases where raw instructions are needed, but these should be kept to a minimum.
16. You will be asked to fix your PR if folders like `.vscode` or `.idea` are included in the PR. These folders are
    specific to your IDE and should not be included in the PR.
17. If you are adding a new feature, make sure to add tests for it. This will make sure that the feature works as
    expected and will help prevent regressions in the future.
18. If you are fixing a bug, make sure to add a test that reproduces the bug. This will make sure that the bug is fixed
    and will help prevent regressions in the future.
19. If your code isn't sufficiently documented, you will be asked to add documentation.
20. If your code doesn't have tests where it should, you will be asked to add tests.

## Notes on formatting

Some IDEs have an automatic formatter that will format the code when you save. It is recommended to use this feature to
keep the code formatted correctly.
<br> If you are using VSCode, you can use the `rust-analyzer` extension to format the
code
automatically. This [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67861602/15894829) explains how to set this
up.<br>
If you are using a JetBrains IDE (Intellij, RustRover, CLion, etc.), you can use the `Rust` plugin to format the code
automatically (This plugin is not required for RustRover).
This [Docs page](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/reformat-and-rearrange-code.html#reformat-on-save)
explains how to set this up. Clippy formatting on the fly is recommended as well, though this can cause a noticeable
performance hit.

Automatic formatting is highly recommended as it will ensure that the code you write is correctly formatted as you go,
instead of running `cargo clippy` when you are done and having 400 clippy errors to fix at once. You should still run
the clippy and fmt commands before submitting a PR to make sure that the code is correctly formatted and passes the
lints,
but automatic formatting will help to catch most of these issues as you go.
